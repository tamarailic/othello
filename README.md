# Othello game in Python

This is my project from Data Structures and Algorithms class. The idea is to use game tree and hashmaps to make and AI to play othello game against. The board is represented by 8x8 matrix and every possible situation on board is presented as State object. AI makes game tree where it tries to find the best possible move for itself.
